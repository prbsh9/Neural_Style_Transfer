# Neural Style Transfer

An implementation of neural style in TensorFlow.
<br> 
This implementation is a lot simpler than a lot of the other ones out there, thanks to TensorFlow's really nice API and automatic differentiation.
<br> 

TensorFlow doesn't support L-BFGS (which is what the original authors used), so we use Adam. This may require a little bit more hyperparameter tuning to get nice results
