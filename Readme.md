# Be careful about:

You dont need to download anything if u use google colab but should download imagenet-vgg-verydeep-19.mat if u want
to make it run in your local machine or else where from ****************************** this link.

Content image, style image size should match. Now it would work fine if Content and Style images are 425 * 425. 
Change image height and image width of nst_utilis.py for changing generated image size from 425 * 425 from other.
